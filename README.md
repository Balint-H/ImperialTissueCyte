This repository is for sharing resources for using the TissueCyte 1000 (TissueVision Inc.) microscopy system, for aquiring serial two-photon images of tissue volumes, such as a mouse brain.

Code for stitching pipelines and software written to aid in data aquisition from the system can be found above, in the **_Code_** tab. Details about the TissueCyte system, protocols of operation, modifications and additional information and resources can be found in the **_Wiki_** tab.

The TissueCyte system is currently housed in Schultz lab at Imperial College London.
